Welcome to the AVT Utilities&trade; Project!
===============================================================

The Algorithm Validation Toolkit&trade; (AVT&trade;) Open Source project is a set
of tools that facilitate the testing and statistical comparison of image processing
algorithms.  It is built upon the
[eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org)
development framework.  

The AVT Utilites&trade; (MVT&trade;) component of AVT&trade; are a set of libraries,
that are utilized by various AVT components.  The libraries are primarily written in c++.
They include:

* extensions to the [XIP Libraries&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-libraries),
* XIP Libraries scene graphs, with processing pipelines,
* connectors to a statistical calculation engine, such as the
  [R server](http://www.r-project.org/).
